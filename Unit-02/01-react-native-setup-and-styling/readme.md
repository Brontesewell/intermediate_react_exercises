# React Native Styling Exercise

Create a static app that looks like this:

None of the data needs to be dynamic.  You can make up the values for the day of the week, weather, temperature, etc.

To implement this app, you will likely need to use:

* [react-native-linear-gradient](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-linear-gradient)
* [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)

As my background, I used this image:
