# Part 1 - React Router Zoo

For this assignment, you'll be using the `<Route>` and `<Link>` components in React Router to build a simple zoo application.

First, build at least three animal components (e.g. `Dog`, `Cat`, or `HoneyBadger`). Then build an application with a navbar that lets you click on different animals to see their corresponding components. Clicking on a link should update the route to display the name of the animal.

As a bonus, refactor your zoo to just use a single `Animal` component, which you pass props too inside of the `Route`!

# Part 2 - React Router Calculator

For this assignment, you'll be creating another calculator using routes. But this time, you'll be using React Router!

Your application should support `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`, and it should render the correct value given the inputs in the route. For example, going to `/add/4/5` should render 9 on the page.

Good luck!
