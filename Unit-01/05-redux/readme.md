# Redux Exercise

Build a simple todo application but include redux to manage your data! You should have actions for creating and deleting todos. 

Remember that since you are using redux, all of your reducers must be pure functions so each of these CRUD operations **must** be done using pure functions. 

You can use a Redux CDN [here ](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/redux) as well as jQuery for DOM manipulation.

**Do not bulid this application using React - this should strictly be done with Redux**

As a bonus, add your todos to localStorage so that you can have some persistance!
